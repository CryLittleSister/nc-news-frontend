A couple more things:
- For hosting [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/22/deploy-react-apps-in-less-than-30-seconds/) is pretty good. There is a section about it in the README generated by create-react-app (there are more alternatives there)
- They should also check that any changes that they hastily made to their back end didn’t break any tests.
